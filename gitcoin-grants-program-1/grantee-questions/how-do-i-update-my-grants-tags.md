# ðŸ“š How do I update my Grant's tags?

To update the tags on your Grant, please complete [the discovery and eligibility tags Google form.](https://forms.gle/vrhoWm1RxNvtRkMZ8)&#x20;

### The information we require

In the form, please include the following information:

* A direct link to the Grant
* The tags you would like to add to the Grant
* **For each tag:** the reason you believe your Grant is eligible for the tag

_Requests without ALL of the required information may not be processed correctly due to the volume of inquiries we receive._

### Timelines

During a Grant Round, we aim to complete all new tag requests within 48-72 hours. However, due to the volume of inquiries, it might take longer than this.

**If a specific tag was not approved, then the round owner decided your Grant didn't meet the criteria.**

**The decision on Eligibility Tags is final and cannot be appealed. If your grant is eligible it will be included in applicable rounds.**
