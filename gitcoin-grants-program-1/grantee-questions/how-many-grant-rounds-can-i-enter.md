# ðŸ¤” How many Grant Rounds can I enter?

In the past you could submit a grant for as many rounds as you like. It was possible to be accepted into the Main Round and multiple side rounds up to a maximum of 5 rounds in total. In our protocol future, this will most likely change. Be sure to check the rules of applying before you apply to any round.

The Gitcoin team will review each submission per platform and main round to confirm eligibility. However, round owners review their applicants separately based on their own rules and some feedback from FDD, and the Gitcoin DAO.&#x20;

In a protocol future, round owners will be able to configure their rounds independently.&#x20;
