# ðŸ¤” How many Grant Rounds can I enter?

You can only apply to one Core Round per person/project, but you are able to apply to as many Featured Rounds as you are eligible for.

**Note:** There is a different checkout flow for each round, therefore your supporters will need to go into each round individually to donate to your project.
