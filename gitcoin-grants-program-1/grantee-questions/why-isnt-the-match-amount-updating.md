# ðŸ’° Why isn't my matching amount updating?

After receiving a contribution to your grant, you might notice that your estimated matching amount is not updated immediately. **This is perfectly normal.**

The algorithm used to estimate matching amounts is performance-intensive and will only run intermittently because of this. The estimated matching amount is expected to update roughly every 5 minutes during a Grants Round. In some cases, it may take slightly longer.
