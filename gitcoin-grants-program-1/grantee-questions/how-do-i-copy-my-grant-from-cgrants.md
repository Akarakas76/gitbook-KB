# ðŸ¤” How do I copy my grant from cGrants?

You can easily access your grant on our old platform (cGrants) through [https://bounties.gitcoin.co/grants/](https://bounties.gitcoin.co/grants/).&#x20;

Sign in and access your grant there. Then you will be able to paste that information into your new grant application into Builder.&#x20;
