# What is Gitcoin Pro?

Our Pro offering provides funders with a wider variety of ways to interact with developers outside of hackathons (visit the [bounty explorer](https://gitcoin.co/explorer) for more details).

### Benefits of this Service include:

\- Gitcoin Tribe (see [https://gitcoin.co/badger-finance](https://gitcoin.co/badger-finance) as an example Tribe)

\- Waiver of the standard 10% bounty fee (post bounties for free)

\- Posting contests and cooperative bounties (where multiple developers can participate in a single bounty)

_Pro is $2k/month, however as we might be moving the bounty platform over to_ [_Buidlbox_](https://buidlbox.io/)_, a new hackathon product by Supermodular launching in 2023. We want to avoid setting users up with a Pro subscription on Gitcoin.co for longer than March 2023 until the roadmap is more clear._\
