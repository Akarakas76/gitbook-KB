# GTC Staking on your Identity

GTC Staking (Identity Staking) is a mechanism that helps to verify your own identity or authenticate someone elseâ€™s by staking GTC.&#x20;

When you stake GTC through Gitcoin Passport (_see the GTC Staking Stamp)_, it enhances your Passport score. This mechanism helps Gitcoin defend against Sybil attacks and is another (very effective) step in making our fraud detection efforts more robust during our Grants Rounds.

Once GTC has been staked, the amount will be locked until a few days after the Grants Rounds have concluded. You will need to return to the [GTC Staking page](https://www.staking.passport.gitcoin.co/StakeDashboard) to reclaim your staked GTC.&#x20;

To get started please visit the [GTC Staking home page](https://www.staking.passport.gitcoin.co/StakeDashboard).

_Note: You can only verify the GTC Staking stamp in Gitcoin Passport if you have either staked on yourself or had GTC staked on you by the community._ \
__\
_You will not be able to verify the Community Staking stamp by staking on another member of the community._&#x20;
