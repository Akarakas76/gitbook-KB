# What is Gitcoin Passport?

[Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co/#/) is an identity verification application. We have written software enabling people to grow personal ledgers of [verifiable credentials](https://decentralized-id.com/web-standards/w3c/wg/vc/verifiable-credentials/) about themselves and organizations to assess their identities to coordinate rights and responsibilities. Users collect “stamps” from different authenticators around web2 and web3, such as [Bright ID](https://www.brightid.org/), [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/), Twitter, and Google.

Gitcoin Passport acts as an aggregator of decentralized society credentials, proving your trustworthiness without needing to collect personally identifiable information. This process transmits more Sybil resistance out to the entire ecosystem.

While we are building the Passport agnostic to specific applications, we are actively exploring its benefits for [personhood proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof\_of\_personhood) and [plurality](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/why-i-am-a-pluralist/) in organizational designs.
