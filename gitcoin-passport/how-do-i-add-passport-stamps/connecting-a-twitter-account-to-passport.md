# ðŸ”Œ Connecting a Twitter account to Passport

This guide gives instructions on connecting a Twitter account to Gitcoin Passport and outlines any known issues.

### Prerequisites

* Gitcoin Passport
  * If you don't already have a Passport setup, you can follow our guide to do that first.
* A Twitter account
  * If you do not have a Twitter account, you can [create one at twitter.com](https://twitter.com/).

### How to verify your Twitter account

Step 1: [Go to passport.gitcoin.co](https://passport.gitcoin.co/) and connect your wallet.

Step 6: Return to the passport browser window and confirm your account is now verified.

You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as Connect Account will now say **Verified**. Alternatively, [you can inspect the Passport JSON.](../commonly-asked-passport-questions/how-to-access-your-passport-json.md)

### Still not working?

If you're unable to connect after following these steps, you can [message Gitcoin support on Gitcoin's Discord](https://discord.gg/b5PEjyVFXT), and we'll try to help resolve your issue.
