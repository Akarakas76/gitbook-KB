Step 6: **Wait for success confirmation.** Do not continue before you receive confirmation of successful linking or it will fail and could cause future issues linking BrightID. Do not close the BrightID app during this time.

You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as Connect Account will now say **Verified**. Alternatively, [you can inspect the Passport JSON.](../common-questions/how-to-access-your-passport-json.md)

### Still not working?
