# ðŸ”Œ Connecting a Google account to Passport

This guide gives instructions on connecting a Google account to Gitcoin Passport and outlines any known issues.

### Prerequisites

* Google Account
* Gitcoin Passport
  * If you don't already have a Passport setup, you can follow our guide to do that first.

### How to verify your Google account

Step 1: [Go to passport.gitcoin.co](https://passport.gitcoin.co/) and connect your wallet.

Step 2: Click **Connect Account** on the Google stamp card.

You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as Connect Account will now say **Verified**. Alternatively, you can inspect the Passport JSON.

### Still not working?

If you're unable to connect after following these steps, you can [message Gitcoin support on Gitcoin's Discord](https://discord.gg/b5PEjyVFXT), and we'll try to help resolve your issue.
