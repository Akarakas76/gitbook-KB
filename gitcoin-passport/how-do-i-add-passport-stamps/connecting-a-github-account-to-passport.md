You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as Connect Account will now say **Verified**. Alternatively, [you can inspect the Passport JSON.](../commonly-asked-passport-questions/how-to-access-your-passport-json.md)

### Still not working?

If you're unable to connect after following these steps, you can [message Gitcoin support on Gitcoin's Discord](https://discord.gg/b5PEjyVFXT), and we'll try to help resolve your issue.
