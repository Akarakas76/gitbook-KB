# ðŸ”Œ Connecting a Discord account to Passport

This guide gives instructions on connecting a Discord account to Gitcoin Passport and outlines any known issues.

### Prerequisites

* A Discord account
  * If you don't already have one, you can [create one at discord.com](https://discord.com/).

### How to verify your **Discord account**

Step 1: [Go to passport.gitcoin.co](https://passport.gitcoin.co/) and connect your wallet.

Step 2: Click **Connect Account** on the Discord stamp card.

You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as Connect Account will now say **Verified**. Alternatively, [you can inspect the Passport JSON.](../commonly-asked-passport-questions/how-to-access-your-passport-json.md)

### Still not working?

If you're unable to connect after following these steps, you can [message Gitcoin support on Gitcoin's Discord](https://discord.gg/b5PEjyVFXT), and we'll try to help resolve your issue.
