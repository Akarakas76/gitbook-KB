# ðŸ”Œ Connecting an ENS account to Passport

This guide gives instructions on connecting an ENS account to Gitcoin Passport and outlines any known issues.

### Prerequisites

* Gitcoin Passport
  * If you don't already have a Passport setup, you can follow our guide to do that first.
* An ENS address held on the wallet address associated with your Gitcoin Passport
  * If you do not have an ENS account, you [can buy one directly from the ENS app](https://app.ens.domains/).

### How to verify your ENS account

Step 1: [Go to passport.gitcoin.co](https://passport.gitcoin.co/) and connect your wallet.

Step 2: Click **Connect Account** on the ENS stamp card.

You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as Connect Account will now say **Verified**. Alternatively, [you can inspect the Passport JSON.](../common-questions/how-to-access-your-passport-json.md)



### Unable to verify ENS Stamp?

If you receive the error Your address does not have an ENS domain associated, that means the owner bought an ENS domain but didnâ€™t set the reverse records.

#### **Solution**

1. You need to set up an ENS reverse record. Please refer to this helpful guide: [https://www.alpharithms.com/ens-reverse-records-guide-552211/](https://www.alpharithms.com/ens-reverse-records-guide-552211/)&#x20;
2. Once you set the ENS reverse records correctly, please come back to verify your ENS stamp.

### Still not working?

If you're unable to connect after following these steps, you can [message Gitcoin support on Gitcoin's Discord](https://discord.gg/b5PEjyVFXT), and we'll try to help resolve your issue.
