  of.

# What are Stamps?

Stamps are verifiable credentials, and by aggregating several of them in one place, Passport distributes trust across multiple entities.&#x20;

_Are you a developer community that requires a GitHub sign-in or an artist collective that requires a Foundation sign-in?_ You can acquire those stamps with the Gitcoin Passport while we handle the registry system for you, so you can save development time and focus on building features your community will value.

With Ceramic, Passport data is also composable and interoperable, providing security across blockchains.
