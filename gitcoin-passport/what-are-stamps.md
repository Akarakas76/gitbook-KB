  of.

# What are Stamps?

Stamps are verifiable credentials, and by aggregating several of them in one place, Passport distributes trust across multiple entities.&#x20;

_Are you a developer community that requires a GitHub sign-in or an artist collective that requires a Foundation sign-in?_ You can acquire those stamps with the Gitcoin Passport while we handle the registry system for you, so you can save development time and focus on building features your community will value.

With Ceramic, Passport data is also composable and interoperable, providing security across blockchains.

### Why have my stamps expired?

Stamps expire and need to be renewed every 90 days. This helps Gitcoin Passport be confident in your unique humanity and makes it more challenging for Sybil users to attack the system. The expiration and renewal cycle also enables humans to re-use stamps and credentials w/ new wallets if they ever lose access to the wallet they used to create a Passport.
