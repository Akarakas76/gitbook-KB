# ðŸ¤” What is Ceramic?

[_Ceramic_](https://ceramic.network/) _is a decentralized data network that brings unlimited data composability to Web3 applications._

Ceramic is a protocol that operates in a public, permissionless way. It provides computation, state transformations, and consensus for all types of data structures stored on the decentralized web. Ceramicâ€™s stream processing enables developers to build dynamic information without trusted database servers to create powerful, secure, trustless, censorship-resistant applications.

Gitcoin Passport is an identity verification application built on and powered by the Ceramic Network.
