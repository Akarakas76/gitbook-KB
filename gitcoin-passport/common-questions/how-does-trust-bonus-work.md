# ðŸ¤” How does Trust Bonus work?

### **What is Trust Bonus?**

Trust Bonus exists to prevent sybil attacks by incentivizing identity verification. In past rounds, Gitcoin has supported BrightID, Proof of Humanity, Idena, ENS, Twitter, POAP, SMS, and Google as optional identity verification techniques. From GR15 onwards, this list will increase to 19 stamps in total.

Trust Bonus gives grant round contributors matching weight. Depending on the amount of verifications an account has, and the level at which those verifications sit, will determine the Trust Bonus score.

_For example_, instead of only taking into account that you have a Twitter account, the amount of followers you have will also be weighted in the scoring algorithm.

_So what does this mean?_ The higher the Trust Bonus of a user is, the more we can be confident that the user is real. Higher Trust Bonuses come with benefits such as higher matching weights for grant contributors.
