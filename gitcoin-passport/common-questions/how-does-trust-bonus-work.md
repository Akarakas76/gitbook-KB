# ðŸ¤” How does Trust Bonus work?

### What is Trust Bonus?

Trust Bonus exists to verify the unique humanity of Gitcoin Grants contributors (Sybil-resistance). In GR14, the Gitcoin Passport has supported [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=de), [Github](https://github.com/), [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/), [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) and four similar providers. From GR15 onwards, this list will increase to 19 stamps in total.

_Trust Bonus gives grant round contributors matching weight on their contributions in the Quadratic Funding program._ Depending on the amount of verifications an account has, and uniqueness of their combination of verified data points, will determine the Trust Bonus score.

_For example_, instead of only taking into account that you have a Twitter account, the amount of followers you have will also be weighted in the scoring algorithm.

_**So what does this mean?**_ The higher the Trust Bonus of a user is, the more we can be confident that the user is real. Higher Trust Bonuses come with benefits such as higher matching weights for grant contributors.

For example, instead of only taking into account that you have a Twitter account, the amount of followers you have will also be weighted in the scoring algorithm.

**But what is going to happen to your data, anon?**

_The Gitcoin Passport application stores all the stamps that Passport holders maintain on the Ceramic Network. When Passport holders submit their stamps to the Gitcoin Grants application, we keep a log of the submitted Passports and stamps mapped to Gitcoin users to determine the Trust Bonus scores for the round contributor._

### Donâ€™t forget to submit your Passport!

Once you have completed your Passport setup with various stamps, donâ€™t forget to submit your passport within your personal Gitcoin profile, under the tab â€˜Trust Bonusâ€™ or visit gitcoin.co/trust once youâ€™re already signed into your account.

_Given the increasing number of sybil attacks weâ€™ve seen from round to round, we have identified how important this is for users and for the ecosystem as a whole. For now, itâ€™s not mandatory to create a Passport (if you donâ€™t have a Passport, youâ€™ll automatically get a 50% Trust Bonus score), but we highly recommend it if you want to create more impact with your donations._
