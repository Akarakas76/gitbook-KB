# ðŸ¤” How do I update my Passport score?

It does not matter if you update your Trust Bonus score before or after you make a donation. It is only important that it is updated to the highest score possible before the Grant Round has ended.&#x20;

After [adding additional stamps to your Passport](../how-do-i-add-passport-stamps/), you'll need to _resubmit_ your Passport on your Gitcoin profile to update your Trust Bonus score.

Step 1: Log into your Gitcoin profile via [gitcoin.co](broken-reference). It will look something like this:

Step 2: Navigate to the 'Trust Bonus' tab.&#x20;

Step 3: Click on 'Refresh Passport."
