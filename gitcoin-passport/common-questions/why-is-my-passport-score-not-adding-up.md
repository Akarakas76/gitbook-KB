# ðŸ¤” Why is my Passport score not adding up?

At times, you may encounter a situation where adding a stamp does not result in an update of your passport score. Alternatively, you might notice that your passport score is lower than the sum of individual stamps you have obtained. The primary reason for this discrepancy is typically the claiming of the same stamp using multiple wallet addresses.

Gitcoin Passport serves as an identity verification application designed to mitigate sybil attacks. When attempting to claim a stamp using more than one wallet address, the score associated with subsequent wallet addresses **will not be added.**

To ensure that your full scores are consolidated within a single wallet, please follow these steps:

1. Identify the other wallets from which you have claimed the same stamp.
2. Connect to Gitcoin Passport using each of these wallets and remove the duplicate stamp.
3. Connect to Gitcoin Passport with your primary wallet, remove the stamp, and undergo the verification process once again.

By following these instructions, your main wallet should reflect the updated score. If you encounter any difficulties in resolving this issue, please feel free to [**contact us**](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/contact-us) without hesitation.
