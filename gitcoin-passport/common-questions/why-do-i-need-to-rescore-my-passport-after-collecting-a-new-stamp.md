# ðŸ¤” Why do I need to rescore my passport after collecting a new stamp?

Gitcoin Passport is powered by data from the Ceramic Network's blockchain. This means Gitcoin and Gitcoin Passport do not have any control over what data you decide to add to the Ceramic Network.&#x20;

Whilst this is great for decentralization and censorship-resistance, it also means that Gitcoin Passport has no way of knowing that your data on Ceramic has changed after you add a new stamp without you telling us.

Most importantly, how Gitcoin Passport is architected means that you (and only you) are in charge of the data that you share with any organization or dApp integrating Gitcoin Passport.
