As we say goodbye to cGrants, we express our deepest gratitude to everyone who contributed to this first chapter of our adventure with Quadratic Funding, as well as those who took advantage of our bounty platform. Now it's time to embrace a new chapter as we transition to a more dynamic future with [Allo Protocol](https://allo.gitcoin.co/), [Gitcoin Passport](http://passport.gitcoin.co) and [Gitcoin Grants Stack](http://gitcoin.co/grants-stack).

Be sure to check out our [new website](https://t.co/VaZA3gwz1i) to learn more about these game-changing projects.

Also, check out the amazing work being done by the [Buidlbox](https://buidlbox.io/) team, who are taking the old bounty platform and elevating it to the next level. Remember, you have until **July 30, 2023** to retrieve any data you want to keep - bounties, payment history, etc. After that, your information will no longer be available.
