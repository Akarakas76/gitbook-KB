# ðŸ¤” Whatâ€™s happening to the Hackathons and the Bounties program?

For years Gitcoin has been known for itâ€™s hackathons and bounties program. Moving forward, this part of Gitcoinâ€™s business will be taken over by [Buidlbox](https://buidlbox.io/), giving space for Gitcoin to focus on itâ€™s Gitcoin Grants Program and [suite of products](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1670892624008364032).

The same hackathons and bounties programs youâ€™ve come to benefit from and enjoy can still be access through [Buidlbox](https://buidlbox.io/).
