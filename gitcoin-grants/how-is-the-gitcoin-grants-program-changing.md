# How is the Gitcoin Grants program changing?

It’s finally time to retire cGrants (our current centralized quadratic funding platform), and to continue toward our end goal as GitcoinDAO: _**to create a decentralized and customizable Grants Protocol.**_

Gitcoin’s renewed purpose which was ratified in July of 2022 is _**To Empower Communities to Fund their Shared Needs.**_ In order to fulfill on this purpose fully, we are creating a suite of permissionless, modular, and decentralized protocols that will allow communities to rapidly test different funding mechanisms on top of a deeply liquid registry of projects and enable projects to grow sustainably.

### Why are these changes being made?

Even though Gitcoin Grants built a strong use case for the value of Quadratic Funding to fund public goods, we built it as a centralized platform. It has come to a stage now where we need to decentralize it to scale it more widely and achieve our purpose.
