# ðŸ’° Where Are Grant Funds Stored?

There are two types of funding:

* **Individual donations**&#x20;
  * No claiming is required as these funds automatically go directly to your wallet at the time of donation. These funds will not show up in your claim history as they were never held by Gitcoin&#x20;
* **Matching funds**&#x20;
  * These are the donations that you received from the matching round that you participate in. The amount is determined by the [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=\&grant=\&grant=\&grant=\&match=1000) mechanism and must be claimed by the grantee after the round has been completed

Some Featured Round Operators prefer to payout matching funds with their own token and you will have to claim each unique token match with a separate on-chain transaction. Unless specifically instructed, other rounds are matched in DAI and are claimed together.
