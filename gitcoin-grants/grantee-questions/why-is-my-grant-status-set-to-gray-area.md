# ðŸ¤” Why is my grant status set to â€˜Gray Areaâ€™?

If your [grant status on Notion](https://gitcoin.notion.site/gitcoin/3940c8762a304e8c9630a05418ebd2a1) is set to Gray Area, the grant reviewer was unable to either approve or deny your Grant based on the current Gitcoin Grants Policy.

Gray Area grants may take more than 48 hours to get fully reviewed as they require a second review from Gitcoin's Grants Intelligence Agency (GIA). **You do not need to do anything, please wait for GIA to review your Grant.**

The Gitcoin Policy team will review gray areas following the Grant Round, and changes made to Gitcoin Policy to reflect this.
