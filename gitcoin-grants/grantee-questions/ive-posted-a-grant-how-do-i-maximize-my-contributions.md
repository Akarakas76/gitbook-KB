# ðŸ“š How do I maximize my contributions?

To maximise the amount of matching funding your Grant receives, you should try to get contributions from the broadest possible audience. Many Grants that have had hundreds of contributors during a Grants Round have generated over $10k in funding.

### How to promote your Grant

* Share your Grant with other communities that you are contributing to.
* Share your Grant on social media (Many find Twitter, in particular, to be helpful).
* If your Grant is for a product that already has users, contact them and ask them to consider contributing.
* Onboard friends and family onto Web3 and ask they contribute to your grant.
* Join [the Gitcoin Discord](https://discord.com/invite/b5PEjyVFXT) and share in the `#ðŸŒ³grants-promotion` channel.
