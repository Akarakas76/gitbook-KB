# ðŸ¤” Can I appeal after my Grant is denied?

If you believe your Grant was incorrectly denied you are able to appeal.

## Reasons you might appeal

* **Reviewer error** - The grant does not violate current policy
* **Updated policy** - [A Gitcoin policy](../../gitcoin-policy/policy/introduction/) was updated which makes your Grant eligible
* **Gray area** - The current policies are unclear in relation to your grant
* **Novel situations** - You believe a current policy should be changed to better reflect the norms of the community
* **Grant creation error** - You accidentally submitted your grant with incorrect or incomplete information, causing it to be denied
