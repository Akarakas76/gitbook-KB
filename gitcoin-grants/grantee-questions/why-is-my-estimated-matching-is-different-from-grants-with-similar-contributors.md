# ðŸ’° Why is my estimated matching is different from Grants with similar contributors?

Grants with similar funding amounts and contributors may have dramatically different estimated matching funds. **This does not mean there is a problem with your Grant.**

There are four main criteria used to calculate QF matching:

* The number of contributors
* The trust bonus of the contributors
* The amount of contribution
* The Grant Rounds the Grant is part of

Any combination of these criteria can cause a difference in estimated matching funds.

It is also important to note that the matching amount shown is only an estimate during a Grants Round and will only be calculated precisely after the Grants Round ends.
