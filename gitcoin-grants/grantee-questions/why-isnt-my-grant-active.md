# ðŸ¤” Why isn't my Grant active?

If the round is active, and your grant isn't active, it's most likely due to the fact that you didn't get your application in in time, or your grant was not approved. Go to [builder.gitcoin.co](https://builder.gitcoin.co/), connect your wallet, and view your grant status there.
