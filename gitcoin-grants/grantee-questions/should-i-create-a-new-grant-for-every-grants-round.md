# ðŸ“š Should I create a new Grant for every Grants Round?

You should not create a new Grant if you already have an existing Grant for the same project. However, you should ensure that you're keeping your Grant up-to-date.

### Updating your Grant

To ensure your Grant remains active, you should update the Grant description at least once every three months. Some things you might want to include:

* Update contributors on progress made on your roadmap
* Let contributors know of any blockers you've run into (maybe they could help!)
* Give an overview of how you've been spending their contributions and the matching funds you previously received

As well as ensuring that your Grant remains active, updating your Grant shows future contributors that you are serious about utilising funding effectively to create public goods and will likely lead to more contributions.
