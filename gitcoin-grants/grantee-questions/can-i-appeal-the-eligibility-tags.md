# Can I appeal the eligibility tags?

The Gitcoin team reviews each submission per platform and main round to confirm eligibility and the round owners review their applicants separately based on their own rules and some feedback from FDD, and the Gitcoin DAO.

If you [requested an eligibility tag](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants/grantee-questions/how-do-i-update-my-grants-tags#the-information-we-require) to participate in an Ecosystem/Cause round, it is important to note that the tags will be added or removed based on the round owner's review of your grant.

If a specific tag was not approved, then the round owner decided your Grant didn't meet the criteria.

The decision on Eligibility Tags is final and cannot be appealed. If your grant is eligible it will be included in applicable rounds.
