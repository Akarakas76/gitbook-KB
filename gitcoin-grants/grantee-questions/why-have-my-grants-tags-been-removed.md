# ðŸ¤” Why have my grants tags been removed?

If you've had tags removed from your grant, someone likely analysed your project, and its tags were deemed unsuitable. Depending on the type of tag, the process for this is different.



A grant can have eligibility tags, discovery tags, or both.

## Eligibility tags

Eligibility tags indicate a project is eligible to get matching funds from a specific ecosystem or cause grants round. External partners (matching owners) provide the matching funds for these rounds.



### **How eligibility tags get added**

Based on the information provided in a grant application, a grants reviewer will add the eligibility tags they think are appropriate.



### Why would an eligibility tag be removed?

A grants reviewer adds an eligibility tag as a recommendation, but the matching owners have subject matter expertise to overrule this decision.

_Matching owners reserve the right to remove the eligibility tag from a grant for any reason._

__

## Discovery tags

Discovery tags improve the discoverability of a grant through the search feature. **Discovery tags make no difference to the amount of matching funding a grant will receive.**

### How discovery tags get added

Based on the information provided in a grant application, a grants reviewer will add the discovery tags they think are appropriate.



### Why would a discovery tag be removed?

If a grants reviewer thinks a discovery tag was given incorrectly to a grant, they will remove it.
