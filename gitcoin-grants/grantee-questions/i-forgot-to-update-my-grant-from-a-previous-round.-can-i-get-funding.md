# ðŸ¤” I forgot to update my Grant from a previous round. Can I get funding?

If you haven't updated your Grant's description in over 60 days it will be excluded from the search results and matching pools during a Grants Round.

If your Grant was approved and active during a previous Grants Road, you can update your Grant's description and it will get added to the matching pool.

_Note: your Grant may take some time to fully update to reflect the changes._
