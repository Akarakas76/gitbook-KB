# My GitHub Account Is Flagged

The use of GitHub is intended to be an easy method for Users to sign into their Gitcoin account as it is a tool built by open source developers for open source developers.

If your GitHub account is flagged, we will not be able to assist you as it is a different product from Gitcoin.

You will need to contact GitHub support at [https://support.github.com](https://support.github.com/) in order to have the restrictions removed from your GitHub account in order to regain access to your Gitcoin profile.
