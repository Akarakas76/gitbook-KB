# ðŸ¤– What is Quadratic funding?

The **quadratic funding mechanism (QF)** is a concrete proposal for turning your small donations into something much larger. It requires a simple formula to achieve this goal.

Crowdfund individual donations towards open source projects (try to have the maximum of contributors, it's the number of participants that counts, not the amount of contribution). A match from governments, grant programs, or private philanthropists (offered by sponsors/donors for the grant's round fund).
