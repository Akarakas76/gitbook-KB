# ðŸ¤¨ My GitHub Account Is Flagged

The use of GitHub is intended to be an easy method for Users to sign into their Gitcoin account as it is a tool built by open source developers for open source developers.

If your GitHub account is flagged, we will not be able to assist you as it is a different product from Gitcoin.

You will need to contact GitHub support at [https://support.github.com](https://support.github.com/) in order to have the restrictions removed from your GitHub account in order to regain access to your Gitcoin profile.

#### GitHub Restriction Update:&#x20;

We are aware of the issues many donors have been experiencing lately with GitHub login, but we have good news on the horizon. \
\
In alignment with our mission as a protocol DAO, your login experience will become more straightforward starting with the [Alpha Rounds in December 2022 and a larger Gitcoin Round in mid-January 2023](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-gitcoin-alpha-tests).&#x20;

Logging in to your profile will simply mean connecting to your web3 wallet. You can manage your decentralized identity and increase your trust bonus by connecting the same wallet to [Gitcoin Passport](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin).
