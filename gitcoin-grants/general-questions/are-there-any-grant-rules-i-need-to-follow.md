# ðŸ“š What are the Grants Round rules I need to follow?

Any contribution that can be converted to USDT will be matched during an active match round. It will be matched as from a new unique contributor provided:

1. It is from a new identity that has not contributed before.
2. Identity requirements continue to evolve but for Grants Round 13 a unique identity is a Github account that is older than the Grants Round.
3. Identity requirements are subject to the pretence that a contribution is not a Sybil attack or collusion.

We define collusion per [the CLR Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06421.pdf) as:

> The central vulnerabilities of LR, as with other mechanisms designed based on the assumption of unilateral optimization, are collusion and fraud. Collusion takes place when multiple agents act in their mutual interest to the detriment of other participants. Fraud takes place when a single citizen misrepresents herself as many.

To call one case out specifically due to confusion in previous rounds, please avoid any form of quid pro quo that has financial value (_i.e. a scenario in which a user gets some additional unique benefit/award in return for their donation_).

We define a [Sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack) as:

> In a Sybil attack, the attacker subverts the reputation system of a network service by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence. It is named after the subject of the book Sybil, a case study of a woman diagnosed with a dissociative identity disorder.&#x20;

### Some definite examples of rule-breaking

* Offering quid-pro-quo for a contribution.
* Creating a new identity to contribute.
* Attempting to falsify a contribution.

We cannot possibly enumerate every single literal example of a breaking of the above rule, so please treat the above list as an incomplete list. You should refer to the definitions of Sybil and collusion attack in the CLR paper as the canonical source of truth for the rules.

Rule violations can lead to a reduction or nullification of your matching bonus.

Any rule violations can be flagged via the **Flag Grant** functionality on the Gitcoin Grants user interface. For transparency, we post about rule violations on [the GitcoinDisputes Twitter](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDisputes) â€“ so follow that account if youâ€™re interested in participating in that governance process.
