# ðŸ¤¨ I see a Grant that is not a public good on the platform, what do I do?

You can Gitcoin's flag feature to report any Grant you feel is not eligible. The **Flag** button appears right below the **Add to Cart** button on the Grant page.

From there, if the community feels strongly that this Grant is not a public good, Gitcoin may ask the Grant owner to update their Grant or remove the Grant from the matching pool.

We hope to decentralize this process in the future.
