description: Major changes to the Gitcoin quarterly Grants Rounds program
---

# ðŸ“š When is the next Grants Round?

Historically, the Gitcoin Grants Rounds operate on a quarterly cadence. However, [Governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/) has approved the decision to sunset centralized grants (cGrants) and transition to the [Grants Protocol](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-grants-protocol).

GR16 will not happen in December of 2022 and instead, weâ€™ll run a streamlined Alpha Round on the protocol in January 2023 with the goal of testing the product while supporting established grantees.\
\
The Alpha Round will consist of 3 separate matching pools: Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, and Climate Solutions. These rounds will only be open to a subset of existing grantees with a goal to support about 300 projects in total.

We will also be running a variety of smaller design partner rounds on the protocol in the weeks ahead to support the design phase of the protocol.\
\
More information about eligibility will be released soon. In the meantime, you can learn more about this decision in the [Governance Forum](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-feedback-request-grants-protocol-alpha-round-eligibility/11873).&#x20;
