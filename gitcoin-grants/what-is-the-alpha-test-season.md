# What is the Alpha Test Season?

The Alpha Test Season is where we will run early design rounds to test grants protocol as part of our transition from our centralized grants platform. Gitcoin is building in public with a select group of design partners to test a new suite of tools and services that aims to power the next wave of community-driven initiatives. These tools include a grants protocol, a fund allocation and distribution protocol (currently in closed beta) that helps communities fund projects within their ecosystem in a transparent way.&#x20;

### _Why are we doing this?_&#x20;

Gitcoin grants built a strong use case for the value of Quadratic Funding to fund public goods, and we're excited to take this centralized experiment and decentralize it to help scale faster. It’s finally time for cGrants (centralized grants, the current QF platform) to be retired and continue toward our end goal as GitcoinDAO: create a decentralized and customizable grants protocol.

### _Where are we going?_&#x20;

Grantees have always been and will continue to be our priority. Gitcoin’s purpose is to empower communities to fund their shared needs (ratified June 2022). In order to do so at scale, we have realized that we need a platform that can handle a full load of what this entails.&#x20;

We are creating a suite of permissionless, modular, and decentralized protocols that will allow communities to rapidly test different funding mechanisms connected to on top of a deeply liquid registry of projects. To read an in-depth explanation of this, please read [Announcing the decentralized future of Gitcoin Grants](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-decentralized-future-of-gitcoin-grants).&#x20;

Over the next few months, we are running “test” Alpha rounds with UNICEF, Fantom, Optimism, and Alchemix. In January, we will run our own Gitcoin test round to ensure that we continue to support early-stage builders as we transition to a decentralized, scalable solution that will support many more communities in funding their shared needs. Keep reading to see if you are eligible and how to participate.&#x20;

This launch signals the beginning of Gitcoin’s transition to a decentralized protocol that will allow any community to coordinate its own grants funding round.
