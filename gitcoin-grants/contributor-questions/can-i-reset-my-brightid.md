# ðŸ“š Can I reset my BrightID?

To ensure Gitcoin is Sybil resistant, **BrightID verification statuses cannot be reset**. If your BrightID verification did not work must [use alternative verification methods](https://gitcoin.co/profile/trust) to increase your trust bonus.

To get help with any alternative verification methods, please [join the Gitcoin Discord](https://discord.gg/b5PEjyVFXT) and ask our support team for assistance.
