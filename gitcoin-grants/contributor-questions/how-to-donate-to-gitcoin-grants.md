# üìö How to Donate to Gitcoin Grants

### What Will I need

All you need is a custodial Web3 wallet such as Metamask. You can watch the video below if you need help setting this up:

### **Where do I start?** <a href="#_xjyfen4gm2xi" id="_xjyfen4gm2xi"></a>

1. Head over to the [Gitcoin Grants website](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) and sign in. If you don‚Äôt have a Github account, you will be prompted to create one.
2. Once you are signed in, connect your Metamask wallet by clicking on the Metamask Fox icon in the top right-hand corner of your browser and following instructions to connect to the Gitcoin Grants site.
3. _**Be aware**_ that if a page you are waiting for isn‚Äôt loading, select the Refresh icon at the top left of your screen. You may be stuck in a Catcha Loop and will need to click the ‚ÄúI am not a robot‚Äù button to proceed.

Start at the Gitcoin Grants home page: [https://gitcoin.co/grants/](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)

### Exploring grants you'd like to donate to

1. Scroll down the [Gitcoin Grants website](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) page and view all of the Matching Rounds e.g., Climate Solutions, DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion), Advocacy, etc.
2. Click on the ‚Äú**View All Grants**‚Äù button at the top of the page, or on one of the Match Rounds banners such as Climate Solutions.
3. If you select the ‚ÄúView All Grants‚Äù button, then you will see a page with a ‚Äú**Tags**‚Äù button in the left corner. If you click on this, you can also choose to view the grants in 1. Main Round, 2. Cause Rounds, or 3. Ecosystem Rounds
4. For the sake of this tutorial, _let‚Äôs say you select the Climate Solutions projects_. When you go to the [Climate Solutions](https://gitcoin.co/grants/explorer/?page=1\&limit=12\&me=false\&sort\_option=weighted\_shuffle\&collection\_id=false\&network=mainnet\&state=active\&profile=false\&round\_num=14\&customer\_name=ClimateChange\&sub\_round\_slug=gr14-climate\&collections\_page=1\&grant\_regions=\&grant\_types=\&grant\_tags=\&tenants=\&idle=true\&featured=true\&round\_type=cause\&tab=grants\&keyword=) page, you will see the Matching Partners for this round. _For example, in the GR14 Climate Solution Round, we had 4 partners who have contributed to a matching pool of $500K: Ocelot Labs, Regen Network, Filecoin Green, and Momus._
5. When you find a grant you‚Äôd like to donate to, click the purple button that says ‚ÄúAdd to Cart.‚Äù In the top right of your screen, you‚Äôll see a little picture of a cart, and the number of grants you‚Äôve selected.

**Adjust your amounts and have fun viewing the estimated match.**

### Make sure that you've created your Gitcoin Passport

**But what is Passport?** Gitcoin Passport is one of the ways we make sure malicious bot accounts aren't able to take advantage of our matching fund. We let people prove they're human by adding 'stamps' of where else their identity can be confirmed such as Twitter, Google, SMS, or Web3 services like ENS, POAP, and BrightID.&#x20;

The more stamps an account has, the more matching funds it can unlock with each donation. To read more about Gitcoin Passport, read this thorough [Introduction](https://gitcoin.co/blog/intro-to-passport).

To gain a better understanding of Sybil Attacks and the importance of Sybil Resistance, read these two articles on [Web3 Identity 101: Episode 1 - Sybil Attacks](https://gitcoin.co/blog/web3-identity-101-episode-1/), and [Streamlining Sybil Defense for Gitcoin Grants with Gitcoin Passport](https://gitcoin.co/blog/streamlining-sybil-defense).

**How do I set up my Passport?** Go to [https://passport.gitcoin.co/](https://passport.gitcoin.co/), connect your Wallet, and then begin collecting stamps by verifying the various decentralized identity verification accounts you‚Äôd like to connect to.

### Allocating crypto & the Quadratic Funding experience

1. Now that you‚Äôve added projects to your cart, you are ready to experience the power of Quadratic Funding (QF); here‚Äôs more about [how QF works](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=\&grant=\&grant=\&grant=\&match=1000).
2. Start the checkout process by clicking on the Shopping Cart button in the top right-hand corner of your screen.
3. You will see a box where you can choose your ‚ÄúAmount/Currency.‚Äù We recommend funding using DAI because it has a 1:1 relationship with the dollar i.e., you won‚Äôt need a calculator to figure out how much you are donating.
4. You can give the same amount to each project by selecting an amount at the top of the page and then clicking on: ‚ÄúApply to All,‚Äù or you can go down your list and customize the amount for each project.\
   \
   _\* As you adjust the amount given, you can see the estimated match amount that they will receive, how fun is that?_\
   \
   _\* Note that some projects are in multiple matching rounds and so will receive more matching for each DAI donated_.
5. If you choose to go through each of your grants and add how much you‚Äôd like to give to each unique project; you‚Äôll see that the automatic amount is $25 DAI, but you can adjust this lower or higher. This is one of the fun, gamified ways to figure out how much you‚Äôd like to give to each project!\
   \
   _\* One beautiful thing about Gitcoin Grants and QF is you can give even a small amount and it can make a real difference._
6. Now you are ready to look at the Summary of your funding in the box on the right-hand side of your screen. As shown in the picture above, you‚Äôll see a ‚ÄúGive Back to the Gitcoin Match Pool‚Äù box with different percentages.\
   \
   _\* We encourage everyone to give to the Gitcoin Matching Pool and become a partner in Gitcoin Grants funding (you can adjust this percentage)._\
   \
   _\* Note: The specific amount you will pay is shown as your ‚ÄúGrant Contribution‚Äù and the ‚ÄúTotal Contribution‚Äù amount is actually your total impact including the estimated match_.\
   \
   Once you are happy with the summary, you are ready to select the purple ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ready to Check Out‚Äù button and proceed to the next step.

**Important to note:** there are three ways to checkout.

### Fund, Support & Amplify

When you select the purple ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ready to Check Out‚Äù box, it will ask you to choose your method of checkout as shown in the image above. There are three different options:

**Standard Checkout (Ethereum Mainnet):** This is the easiest method to checkout with the drawback that gas fees can be high. You will need to have enough DAI in your Metamask Wallet to pay for your donations and enough ETH to cover your gas fees.

* Gas fees are the amount of Ether (ETH) required for an Ethereum blockchain network user to conduct a transaction on the network.
* Try to find a time when gas fees are lower‚Äîthis is _usually in the evenings and on weekends_. Metamask shows you an estimate of the gas fees and will try to get them lower than what it shows. Also, you can use Advanced Options to set a limit for your gas fees. Learn more about [gas fees and how to adjust them here](https://chaindebrief.com/what-are-gas-fees-adjusting-it-on-metamask/#how-to-adjust-gas-fees-on-metamask).
* It‚Äôs less costly and more efficient to donate to multiple projects at one time than to do individual donations at different times.

**zkSync Checkout:** zkSync uses Ramp Network to easily load DAI directly from a credit card. Ramp is supported throughout the world but not in every jurisdiction. [Check here](https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/433-supported-countries-and-territories#h\_0b1cd8d0b4) to see if your location is supported. Many prefer the zkSync Checkout option because although there is a small one-time transaction fee (approximately $8-10 USD), after that, the gas fees are low AND it‚Äôs easy to buy DAI with your credit card via Ramp Network. Also, using the zkSync checkout is a more energy-efficient way to transact than using the Ethereum Mainnet. Here are the steps for zkSync:

1. Choose the zkSync checkout option after clicking on the purple button that says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ready to Checkout‚Äù
2. Connect your wallet by clicking on ‚ÄúETH Connect‚Äù and then selecting ‚ÄúMetamask‚Äù
3. You‚Äôll need to click on the ‚ÄúSignature Request‚Äù button to approve the Metamask transaction
4. On the right-hand side of the page, you can buy DAI with a credit card using a third-party service called Ramp. There are two options to select from 1. The green ‚ÄúTop Up With Ramp‚Äù button to add DAI to your wallet, or 2. The green ‚ÄúBuy with Ramp‚Äù button to fund the specific amount for your projects. We recommend the former and then you will have more DAI added to your wallet‚Äîperhaps to fund even more projects?!
5. Once you‚Äôve added DAI to your wallet, you can click on the ‚ÄúComplete Payment‚Äù on the zkSync Checkout page. Click on the Metamask ‚ÄúSign‚Äù button in the Signature Request pop-up window. This will approve the transaction. You will receive a ‚ÄúDone. Thank you!‚Äù message that shows your funding is complete.

**Polygon Checkout:** Polygon is the option for more advanced users. You will need some Matic (Polygon‚Äôs token) but then you will pay much lower gas fees than with the Standard Checkout. Also, using the Polygon blockchain is a more energy-efficient way to transact. There are three ways to use the Polygon Checkout:

* Transfer Matic and DAI to your wallet by bridging from Ethereum: [https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge)
* If it works in your jurisdiction, you can use an on-ramp to load DAI and Matic into your Polygon wallet: [https://wallet.polygon.technology/on-ramp](https://wallet.polygon.technology/on-ramp)
* Have a friend send MATIC to your wallet

**Verify your account to maximize your match**

Now that you‚Äôve funded your grants, when you return to the Gitcoin Grants page you will see two more optional but important steps:

1. You can select the ‚ÄúShare on Twitter‚Äù button to help amplify the projects you‚Äôve supported
2. Don‚Äôt forget to click on the ‚ÄúVerify‚Äù button to maximize your match. Verified gitcoin users have 100% or more of their donation amount count toward the match fund algorithm while unverified users start with 50%. To ensure Sybil resistance‚Äîprotection against bots and scams‚Äîplease take the time to verify your account by selecting this button.

Finally, if you‚Äôve made it this far, _celebrate_! You have just made a massive difference in the world. Next, take some time to support your favorite projects further by:

* Following their Twitter account(s)
* Joining their Discord(s) and offering to get involved
* Use this link to set up your collection and help others learn about the projects you support: [Create a Collection](https://gitcoin.co/grants/explorer?page=1\&limit=12\&me=false\&sort\_option=weighted\_shuffle\&collection\_id=false\&network=mainnet\&state=active\&profile=false\&round\_num=0\&customer\_name=false\&sub\_round\_slug=false\&collections\_page=1\&grant\_regions=\&grant\_types=\&grant\_tags=\&tenants=\&idle=true\&featured=true\&round\_type=false\&tab=collections).
