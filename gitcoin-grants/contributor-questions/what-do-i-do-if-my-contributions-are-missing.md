# ðŸ“š Why aren't my contributions showing on my profile?

Sometimes aren't logged properly on your Gitcoin profile. Even if your transaction is not logged on your Gitcoin profile, any grants you donated to will have received the funds.&#x20;

You can add them to your Gitcoin profile by using [the add missing contributions form on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/add-missing-contributions).
