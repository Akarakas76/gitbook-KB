# Non-Alpha round grantees

### When can I participate in grants again

* Your community can still contribute to your project via cGrants; however, there is no matching at this time. A more comprehensive range of QF rounds will take place in March and April on the protocol, where we anticipate almost all existing grants will be able to participate.

### When can I access my profile on Grants protocol?

* There is no user profile creation process yet besides Passport; however, in Q1 2023, anyone can create their grant’s profile on Grant’s Hub.

### Why am I not in this round? Why can’t I be in this round? Why are others in this round and not me?

* The eligibility for the limited Alpha rounds and the reasoning behind those decisions can be found [in this Gov post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/discussion-feedback-request-grants-protocol-alpha-round-eligibility/11873).

### How can non-alpha grantees still participate (if possible)?

* Only by donating - but look for announcements on future Alpha rounds and the upcoming protocol launch!
