# üõ† Troubleshooting Passport or Trust Bonus Technical Issues

### **Issue 1:** There is no Ceramic Account associated with your wallet

Usually, this means that you created your Passport on another network (i.e., not Ethereum Mainnet).

#### **Solution:**

1. Return to [passport.gitcoin.co](http://passport.gitcoin.co/)
2. Confirm the network you are logged into with your wallet.
3. If your Passport is on any other network but Ethereum, log out of that network. It should also send you back to the main site.
4. Switch your wallet to Ethereum Mainnet.
5. Click ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù.
6. Return to [gitcoin.co/trust](http://gitcoin.co/trust) and log in with your Ethereum wallet and connect your passport.

### **Issue 2:** The Trust Bonus page does not respond after you click ‚ÄúConnect Passport‚Äù

The issue is often related to the Brave browser blocking JavaScript.

#### **Solution:**

Turn off the Brave shields and try again.

### Issue 3: Your address does not have an ENS domain associated

The funder bought an ENS domain, but didn‚Äôt set the reverse records.
