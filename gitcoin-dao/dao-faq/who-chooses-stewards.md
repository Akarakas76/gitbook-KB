# üè¢ Who chooses Stewards?

## What is a Steward?

A Steward helps guide GitcoinDAO by engaging in the Gitcoin governance process and voting on behalf of those who have delegated their voting power to them.

## Who chooses Steward?

Technically, anyone can nominate themselves to [become a Steward](how-do-i-become-a-gitcoin-steward.md). However, the impact Steward's have is determined by the amount of GTC they have been delegated by the community support. The Stewards with the most voting power are those who the community have signalled&#x20;
