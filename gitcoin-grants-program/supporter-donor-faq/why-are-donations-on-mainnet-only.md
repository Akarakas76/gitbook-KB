# ðŸ“š Why are donations on mainnet only?

As we've transitioned towards decentralization, our new grants platform is fully onchain. This means that currently, we only accept donations on ETH Mainnet.&#x20;

### Why onchain?&#x20;

* We represent your project in a single place, onchain
* Through [Grants Stack](broken-reference), your project will be ready for any grants program, on any chain
* Because it's onchain, we can reference it from any smart contract you can start to accrue reputation to your project
* Audibility
* Transparency
* Interoperability with other onchain tools

_We're exploring ways of deploying on cheaper chains, and other technologies that will make it cheaper, and we're working on bringing the cost down._&#x20;
