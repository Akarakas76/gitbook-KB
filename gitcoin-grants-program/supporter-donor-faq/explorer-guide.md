# ðŸ“š Explorer Guide

## TL;DR

_Explorer allows supporters (donors) to browse through and donate to projects that have been approved in any single round. **It is not possible to donate to multiple rounds simultanously, only multiple projects within a round.** For example, if you want to donate to Climate Solutions, Ethereum Infrastructure, and a featured round, you'll need to go through the below process per round._&#x20;

To visit Explorer, you will need to go to the specific link for each round. Round operators will share those through the specific roundâ€™s Explorer via a direct link on Twitter, website, etc. We will also have a page where all the links live that will be shared before the round goes live.

### Pre-Round Screen

_The Explorer landing page UI changes based on whether a round has started or not. If a round has not begun yet, you won't be able to view the projects yet. On the pre-round screen the information for that specific round will be displayed._

### Active Round Screen

Once Round Operators have approved projects for their round and the round has begun, the landing page would then look something like this:

You will be able to:

* Browse through projects
* Search and sort through projects
* Add projects to your cart
* Click on projects to learn more about them

### Project Details page

As you browse the landing page, you might want to click on a project to learn more about it. You will be led to a page that looks like this:

Here, you will be able to:

* Learn more about a project
* Browse through their website, social media, GitHub, etc.
* See how much funding theyâ€™ve received thus far
* See how many contributors have contributed thus far
* See how many days are left in the round
* Add their project to your cart

### How to donate

Make sure you've [connected your wallet.](how-to-connect-your-wallet.md)&#x20;

Next, visit the round(s) you want to donate to! Here, you will be able to browse through the various projects that are included in that round:

You can browse through the different projects, and add them to your cart as you go (either on the screen above or the project screen below):

Next, once you've added all the projects to your cart, go to checkout:

Here, you'll be allocate funds in your chosen denomination individually to each project, or you can include an "amount" to allocate to all projects simultaneously. Once you've completed this, you'll be prompted to "submit your donation:"

You have now successfully donated to a Gitcoin Grants Round! _Remember, if you'd like to donate to multiple rounds, you will need to go through them individually. Each transaction will incur a gas fee_.
