# ðŸ“š Explorer Guide

## TL;DR

_Explorer allows supporters (donors) to browse through and donate to projects that have been approved in any single round._&#x20;

To visit Explorer, you will need to go to the specific link for each round. Round operators will share those through the specific roundâ€™s Explorer via a direct link on Twitter, website, etc. We will also have a page where all the links live that will be shared before the round goes live.

_**Please visit**_ [_**grants.gitcoin.co**_](https://grants.gitcoin.co/) _**to browse rounds you'd like to support.**_&#x20;

### Pre-Round Screen

_The Explorer landing page UI changes based on whether a round has started or not. If a round has not begun yet, you won't be able to view the projects yet. On the pre-round screen the information for that specific round will be displayed._

### Active Round Screen

Once Round Operators have approved projects for their round and the round has begun, the landing page would then look something like this:

You will be able to:

* Browse through projects
* Search and sort through projects
* Add projects to your cart
* Click on projects to learn more about them
* Multi-round checkout

### Project Details page

As you browse the landing page, you might want to click on a project to learn more about it. You will be led to a page that looks like this:

Here, you will be able to:

* Learn more about a project
* Browse through their website, social media, GitHub, etc.
* See how much funding theyâ€™ve received thus far
* See how many contributors have contributed thus far
* See how many days are left in the round
* Add their project to your cart
