# ðŸ“š Why aren't my contributions showing on my profile?

_Note: If you used Explorer to donate to a project the transactions will not be reflected on your Gitcoin profile as Explorer is completely decentralized and only a non-custodial wallet is required. A Gitcoin profile is not needed._

Sometimes transactions aren't logged properly on your Gitcoin profile. Even if your transaction is not logged on your Gitcoin profile, any grants you donated to will have received the funds.&#x20;

You can add missing transactions to your Gitcoin profile by using [the add missing contributions form on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/add-missing-contributions).
