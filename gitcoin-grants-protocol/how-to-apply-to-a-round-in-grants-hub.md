# How to apply to a round in Grants Hub

Do you want to apply to a round? _Here’s how._

There's three possible journeys currently:

1: You arrive at [granthub.gitcoin.co](http://granthub.gitcoin.co/) directly > you can create a project -- that's it.

2: You can arrive via the special application link the first time, and we'll detect that you haven't created a project yet and redirect you to create a project first. When you're done creating a project, you'll see a banner to apply to the round. Then you can return to the application page and fill out and submit an application

3: You've created a project in the past (see #1) and then you received the special application link. Then you can directly apply (since you've created a project already).

* Once you’re through, click on “Apply to this round.”

* Next, you’ll see the Grant Round Application page, where you’d be able to select which of your projects you want to apply with that round.

* Answer a series of required questions that follow.
*   When it’s all complete, click on “Preview Application,” where you can see your application answers before you submit. _Make sure that all the information is captured correctly,_ then click “Submit.”

    * You will then be prompted to “Sign” through your wallet.

    _Note: with each application you submit,_ you will have to pay gas fees, because creating/editing a project is an on-chain transaction\*.\*
