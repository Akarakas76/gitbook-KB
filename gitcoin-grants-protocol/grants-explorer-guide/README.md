# Grants Explorer Guide

## TL;DR

_Grants Explorer allows donors to browse through and donate to projects that have been approved in any single round._

### Pre-Round Screen

The Grants Explorer landing page UI changes based on whether a round has started or not. If a round has not begun yet, the landing page could look something like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/App. landing.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This page allows you to get information on:

* What the round name is and a short description
* When the application period is
* When the round period is
* How much matching funds are available
* Round eligibility requirements with a button that lets you apply to the round on Grants Hub if you choose to do so

### Active Round Screen

The UI of the landing page will change once the round becomes active. That is, once Round Operators have approved projects for their round and the round has begun. The landing page would then look something like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Landing.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will be able to:

* Browse through projects
* Search and sort through projects
* Add projects to their Shortlist
* Click on projects to learn more about them

### Project Details page

As you browse the landing page, you might want to click on a project to learn more about it. You will be led to a page that looks like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Project Details.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here, you will be able to:

* Learn more about a project
* Browse through their website, social media, GitHub, etc.
* See how much funding they‚Äôve received thus far
* See how many contributors have contributed thus far
* See how many days are left in the round
* Add their project to the Shortlist

### The Shortlist

Now, you may be wondering, ‚ÄúWhat the heck is the Shortlist?‚Äù The Shortlist is an interactive tool that allows you to visualize how you distribute your impact across projects as you make your decisions.

As you browse projects on GE, you are able to add projects you like to a non-finalized list that we call the Shortlist. After you are done browsing projects and want to move to the donation portion of the process, you can view your Shortlist by clicking on the Shortlist icon in the top right of the page. You will be greeted with a page like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Empty Final Ballot.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here, you will be able to do a number of things:

* Review your Shortlist
  * Keep adding projects to it
  * Remove projects
  * Select which projects make it on their Final Donation list
  * Bulk add projects to their Final Donation list or bulk remove projects from your Shortlist
* Final Donation list
  * Bulk fund projects: you are able to select which currency you want your donation in (pre-set by the Round Operator) and how much money you would like to distribute to each of the projects
  * Fund projects individually
* Submit your Final Donation

You then want to select certain projects for your Final Donation:

After you are satisfied with your selection, the selected projects will move over to the Final Donation list.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Pre Donation Input 4 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here you will be able to fund projects individually, or choose to fund projects uniformly, using the bulk donation feature.

_You can, at any time, add projects back to your Shortlist if you change your mind._

Once you are satisfied with the projects you've chosen and the donation amount, you are able to submit your donation. You must **connect your wallet** in order to submit your donation:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Pre Donation Input 8.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you connect your wallet, a few pop-ups will appear to facilitate wallet connection: in the first pop-up, you'll be able to:

* Choose from a list of wallets to connect to
* Obtain a wallet if you don't have one&#x20;

If you _don't_ have a wallet, you can choose to create a wallet and connect:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Pre Donation Input 9.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you _do_ have a wallet, you'll be able to connect your wallet by selecting it from the list.&#x20;

For example, if you hold a MetMask wallet, it'll look a bit like this:

* First, you must enter your password

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Pre Donation Input 13.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Then, you must choose which account you'd like to connect

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Pre Donation Input 11.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Finally, you must confirm and then connect

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Pre Donation Input 12.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**When you submit your donation**, you will see this popup giving you a heads up that you will have to sign a couple of transactions using the wallet of your choice.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Pre Donation Input 6.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you agree, a processing modal will pop up showing the progress of the transactions:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Pre Donation Input 7.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once everything is submitted and finalized, you're greeted with a confirmation screen:

And boom! You‚Äôve successfully donated to some cool projects in a cool round. High five üòé üôå
