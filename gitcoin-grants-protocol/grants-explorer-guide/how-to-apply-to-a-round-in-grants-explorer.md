# How to apply to a round in Grants Explorer

To visit Grants Explorer, you will need to go to the specific link for each round. Round operators will share those through the specific round’s Grants Explorer via a direct link on Twitter, website, etc.

You will see all the accepted projects within the round. _**Note: this page will display as below only when the donation/voting period has opened. Before that time, the home page will have a different interface.**_

To get started with applying to the round, follow these steps:

Step 1: Click on “Apply to Grant Round”

_This will open up to an application for this specific round._

Step 2: You will see the necessary details for the specific round. Click on “Apply to this round” to continue.

Step 3: You will see a form where you will need to fill in all the required details. _**Note: If you have no projects, the application will redirect you to create a project first, and then it will prompt you to apply to the round you came in originally with.**_

You can then preview your application by clicking on “Preview Application” on the bottom right of the screen. _**Make sure that you have input all your information correctly before continuing on and submitting.**_

Step 4: Once you are happy, click “Submit,” which will open your connected wallet. A prompt will follow to sign the transaction, and you will need to pay the necessary gas fee to apply.

The application will then be received into the system. Give it a few minutes to process:
