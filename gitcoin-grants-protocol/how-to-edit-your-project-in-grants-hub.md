# How to edit your project in Grants Hub

To edit your project on Grants Hub, visit [granthub.gitcoin.co](http://granthub.gitcoin.co). \
\
**Note:** _You can only edit your grant up until the round goes live! If you must edit your grant after the round is live, you must re-apply to your round as a new grant. This is done to ensure Sybil protection._

Step 1: Once you’re in your Grants Hub dashboard, you will see a list of your active projects. Click on the one you’d like to edit:

Step 2: Click on “Edit Project” on the top right.

It will take you through the same flow as when you created your project (_see How to Create a Project on Grants Hub_).

Step 3: Make all the necessary changes, by clicking “Next,” and finalize by clicking “Save and Publish.”

After editing your project you must reapply to the round you desire to participate in.&#x20;

_Note: each time you edit and “Save and Publish,” you will have to pay gas fees because creating/editing a project is an on-chain transaction._ \
