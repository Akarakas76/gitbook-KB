# What is Grants Hub?

[Grants Hub](https://grantshub.gitcoin.co/) is one of the core product domains for Grants Protocol — it focuses on tools for project owners to create and manage their own projects, and build project reputation. This will feed a universal project registry, from which round operators can source projects for their rounds.

### What is the purpose?

Grants Hub’s purpose is to be used as a vehicle for growth over time after owners use the protocol as a place where they incept their project’s existence. As an open-source, permissionless protocol it will provide critical infrastructure to other projects that support and enable project growth over time. See it as the web3 space for creating a connected home for your project that allows you to build a reputation for sustainable fundraising, recruiting talent, reporting progress over time, and promoting your expertise.
