# How to create a project in Grants Hub

**Note:** _You can only edit your grant up until the round goes live! If you must edit your grant after the round is live, you must re-apply to your round as a new grant. This is done to ensure Sybil protection._\
\
Firstly, you’ll need to connect your wallet. Go to [grantshub.gitcoin.co](https://grantshub.gitcoin.co/), and click on “Connect Wallet.” Here you’ll have the option to connect via Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, or WalletConnect.

_If you don’t have a wallet set up already, click on “Get a Wallet” to set up your wallet, or “Learn More” to learn more about wallets._

### Steps to Submitting Your Project&#x20;

1. Go to the specific Gitcoin Grants Hub link and connect your wallet.

&#x20; a. Grants Hub is one of the core areas of the new Grants Protocol — it focuses on tools for project owners to create and manage their projects and build project reputations. This will feed a universal project registry, from which round operators can source projects for their rounds.

&#x20; b. **Note:** If you have multiple team members, ensure that the person most likely to update your proposal is the one submitting your project. For the Alpha test, only one person will have access to editing your project on the Grants Hub.&#x20;

&#x20; 2\.   Select either the purple "+New Project" button or the "Create a Project" button as shown below:

3\. Select the correct network for your round.&#x20;

4\. Next, you will go to the Project Details page as shown below:

&#x20; a. Note the required sizes for your project logo (300x300 px) and your project banner (1500x500 px)  ⤵️

&#x20; b. You can copy & paste your GR15 proposal from cGrants into the Project Description box, but images & links will not be accepted during this test round. The protocol currently only accepts basic text with no formatting.&#x20;

&#x20; c. We suggest you use the space bar to add clear headings and separate paragraphs to help contributors read your proposal. Here are some suggestions that you could include: Problem, Solution, Update Since GR15, Plans for Alpha Round Funding, Team Members, etc.

5\. On the next page, you will be able to verify your social accounts.&#x20;

&#x20; a. If connecting to Twitter, be sure that you are currently logged into your project’s Twitter account.

6\. Select the Next button and you will see a preview of what your project will look like. Once you’re happy with how it looks, select “Save and Publish.”&#x20;

&#x20; a. A wallet prompt will open up again. To create the project, you’ll need to pay a gas fee, which will be displayed in your wallet window. Click on “Confirm” to finalize.

&#x20; b. It might take a few seconds for the transaction to process. Once it is complete, you’ll see a popup at the bottom that says, “Project Created!”

7\. You can edit your project by following [these simple instructions](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-protocol/edit-your-project-in-grants-hub). Note that each time you edit and “Save and Publish,” you will need to pay gas fees because creating/editing a project is now an on-chain transaction.&#x20;

&#x20; a. **Important:** You can only edit your grant up until the round goes live! If you must edit your grant after the round is live, you will need to re-apply to your round as a new grant. This is done to ensure Sybil protection.
