# What is Gitcoin?

### Our Purpose

Our purpose is to empower communities to fund their shared needs. This purpose guides our work as both an impact and protocol DAO. We are focused on building and funding tools that support community-driven shared resources.

### How we support our purpose

Gitcoin is a community first, and our software products are a double-sided market that connects digital creatives to the people who want to fund their work. As of November 2022, we’ve created [$72.3m worth of funding.](https://gitcoin.co/results)

### The DAO that governs Gitcoin

In order to make sure that Gitcoin is serving its mission and community first, Gitcoin is governed by the community. In May 2021, [GTC was released](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-gtc-gitcoins-governance-token/). GTC is a governance token with no economic value that governs Gitcoin Grants + GitcoinDAO.

There are three important concepts to know to understand how to interact with GitcoinDAO.

1. Most of the action happens on [Discord](https://gitcoin.co/discord), [gov.gitcoin.co](https://gov.gitcoin.co), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitcoin)
2. [Stewards](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-the-community-stewards-program/) are ultimately responsible for governing GitcoinDAO.
3. Workstreams are the primary mechanism through which work is organized in the DAO.

#### DAO Workstreams

1. [Gitcoin Product Collective](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Gitcoin-Product-Collective-f2860138cbb24505b5cb2d8576119a78) is the DAO's product development team and [Moonshot Collective](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Moonshot-Collective-e8a5bbb2b6f3494db109849d159e1b51) was the DAO's rapid prototyping workstream. They have both merged into a single Workstream within the DAO.&#x20;
2. [Public Goods](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Public-Goods-4ccd579f433c4dff9d8952314468d6e8) is focused on our mission of funding public goods.
3. [Fraud Detection & Defense](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Defense-2bde13c0b8e74fda81435d94e49e2703) is in charge of preventing fraud on Gitcoin Grants.
4. [Memes, Merch, & Marketing](https://www.notion.so/Merch-Memes-Marketing-c1bd89fac8ab4569bf2a676df28025d8) is the DAO marketing division.
5. [DAO Ops](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Ops-84f425e281ae49579a2b4acf0bad5dd5) handles DAO operations.



#### DAO’s Quarterly Cadence

Gitcoin operates in a quarterly cadence. Every quarter, the Gitcoin ecosystem revolves around a quarterly stacked event - a combination of Gitcoin Grants Rounds, and Hackathons - where millions of \$$$ of funding are deployed to the community. Typically a quarter looks like this:

1. Plan for the quarterly stacked event
2. Execute the quarterly stacked event
3. Learn from the quarterly stacked event
4. Repeat

The next quarterly event is GR16, starting in Q4 2022.

Such a good way to learn! - sarasioux.eth
